This Node.js app listens to TWitter mentions for a configured Twitter account. New mentions are stored in the database by twitter_listener and processed by twitter_handler.

The twitter_handler module parses the mention text. If a known command is sent to the account, the twitter_handler fulfills the request. 

To run the module, create a Twitter application on https://dev.twitter.com and enter the consumer_key and consumer_secret of your application in the configuration file. Use config/config.development.coffee for the development environment and config/production.coffee for the production environment. Also enter the access_token and access_token_secret of the account for which the twitter_enganger will listen to mentions. The access token can be retrieved by logging in with Twitter to an app that supports oauth, for instance by using the Node.js Passport module.
